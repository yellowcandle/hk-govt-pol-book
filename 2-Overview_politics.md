### Note on the Pro-Establishment Camp:

1.  Some of these political groups and politicians are often referred to
    as “the leftists” in Hong Kong, due to their affiliation with the
    PRC and the CCP.  
2.  Strictly speaking, the beliefs and ideas they have are not “left”
    (Socialist); rather, they are “right-leaning” (Capitalist) for the
    discussion of political orientation. (e.g.: Compare the
    Pro-Establishment Camp’s stance on social welfare issues with those
    of the LSD and the LP)
