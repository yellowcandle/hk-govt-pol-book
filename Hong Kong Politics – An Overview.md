### Note on the Pro-Establishment Camp:

1. Some of these political groups and politicians are often referred to as “the leftists” in Hong Kong, due to their affiliation with the PRC and the CCP.  
2. Strictly speaking, the beliefs and ideas they have are not “left” \(Socialist\); rather, they are “right-leaning” \(Capitalist\) for the discussion of political orientation. \(e.g.: Compare the Pro-Establishment Camp’s stance on social welfare issues with those of the LSD and the LP\)
