# The Hong Kong Legislature — A Primer

## History of the Legislative Council

In the colonial period, the Hong Kong Government had been appointing the members of the LegCo until the late-80s. The 30/30 allocation of the Geographical Constituencies and the Functional Constituencies had not been changed until the implementation of the 2012 Political Reform Package, in which the LegCo membership had been expanded to 35/35, with 5 of the FCs seats returned from the newly established District Council \(II\) FC. All the eligible voters who do not have a vote in the traditional FCs can instead vote in the DC\(II\) FC.  
The 2016/17 Political Reform Package did not propose any changes regarding to the LegCo election.

## Allocation of seat in the LegCo

The allocation of seats to different geographical constituencies changes according to the latest population ratio of among the five GCs \(Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East, Kowloon West, New Territories East, and New Territories West\).[^1]  
The Functional Constituencies comprise of 28 “Traditional Functional Constituencies” and the District Council \(II\) FC.[^2]

## Shortcomings of the current legislature

### The Split Voting System

The Split Voting System refers to the separation of the LegCo members into two groups — the GCs members and the FCs members.  
For the bills introduced by the government, all votes of the members would be counted together, in which a simple majority \(&gt;50%\) is needed passing the bill.  
However, for the bills and motions introduced by the Council Members, the votes would be counted separately \(GCs and FCs\), in order for the bills and the motions to be passed, _both_ the GCs and the FCs _Yes_ votes have to be more than 50%.

### Corporate Votes and Winning-by-default

Out of the 28 Traditional FCs, 18 of them allow Corporate Voters to vote, some political commentators criticize whether the small number of voters can represent the voices of the whole sector.  
The small number of voters \(that is, the eligible people to run for the seats\) also enable them to collaborate and suppress people who wants to run for the seat. As a result, 10 of the 30 Traditional FCs seats are returned without contest.

## In defence of the Functional Constituencies

Article 45 of the Basic Law stipulates that the “ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage” with “the principle of gradual and orderly progress“. Nevertheless, some politicians comment that the FCs serve an important role in the current political system by including the pillar industries of Hong Kong in the legislature.
